#' @param <%= ifelse(isgeneric, "value", "proportion") %> an numeric value indicating the proportion of homoplasy missing values are assumed to have under implied weighting. This parameter is only valid when \code{weighting} is set to \code{implied} and \code{multi_k} is \code{TRUE}. A proportion of 0 is equivalent to standard implied weighting, with \code{multi_k} set as \code{FALSE}.
