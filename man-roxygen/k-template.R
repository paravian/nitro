#' @param <%= ifelse(isgeneric, "value", "k") %> an numeric value indicating the concavity constant to apply during an implied weights analysis. This parameter is only valid when \code{weighting} is set to \code{implied}. When \code{multi_k} is \code{TRUE}, \code{k} represents the concavity for a character with no missing entries and serves as the basis for calculating per-site concavity constants.
